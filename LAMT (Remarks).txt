Backend
⦁	App.py functionality is missing (Flask)
⦁	Diagonalizer Logic should just be pure computation. No inputs, need nya i-return 'yung output to HTML. (That's Frontend Stuff)
⦁	Logic is Correct (From my understanding)
⦁	(Suggestion) Use the SymPy library instead of NumPy for better formatting No more decimals.


Frontend
(IDK if kasama me here, sinama ko na hehe -JM)
⦁	About Us 😎
⦁	(Suggestion) We can omit "Home" and have "Diagonalize" be the landing page instead.
⦁	(Suggestion) Should the concept/definition of "Diagonalization" be included here as well? 
⦁	(Suggestion) A dynamic table instead of inputted one. 
    The inputted values in the table must be turned into a matrix to be sent to the backend.
