# **LINEAR ALGEBRA FINAL PROJECT**

**Linear Algebra** is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.
It provides the theoretical foundation for understanding matrix operations and their applications across science, engineering, and computer science.

# **TASK: AUTOMATED MATRIX DIAGONALIZER**

The goal of this project is to build an application that:

* Accepts an **n × n matrix A** (where n ≤ 5)
* Checks whether the matrix is **diagonalizable**
* If diagonalizable, generates:
  * A **nonsingular matrix P**
  * A **diagonal matrix D**
    such that **P⁻¹AP = D**

**Matrix diagonalization** transforms a matrix into diagonal form, simplifying complex computations.
This technique is essential for:

* Solving differential equations
* Computing matrix powers
* Understanding the behavior of linear systems
